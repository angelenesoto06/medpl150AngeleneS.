<p>Lab Work (Week 1) I want to major in Psychology, and while watching animated flims, I love the color changes in scences that animators do. I would like to explore some animated flims and see why certain scenes are colored differently and the feelings those scenes invoke. I think many feel that a movies soundtrack invokes the most feeling however, I disagree. When a scene uses different colors or settings than the rest, it automatically make us wonder why there might be a change. I am excited to learn about different forms of media, like short flims and maybe journalism, and I cannot wait to see the artwork of my peers as well</p>
