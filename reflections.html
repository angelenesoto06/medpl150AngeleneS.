<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>This is my first reading reflections:When I take photos, I try to capture special memories. For instance, if I am having fun with friends I try to take a photo or video. That way I can always look at that photo and smile. My favorite photos to take were of my cat, Silley. She could be standing still or jumping around and I would snap a photo right then and there. I used to use my mother’s iPad to edit some photos that I took of her. I would make them darker, lighter. I would blur the background of the photos just to make her the main focus of the photos. I think those photos represented how much she meant to me. How I could forget about all my troubles or anything else I was going through the moment she looked at me. By making her the center of those photos and blurring the background, I feel that viewers looking at those photos could tell how much she meant to me and the effect she had on me. I also love taking photos of my brothers when they are walking down the street. I have plenty of photos of my brothers walking and they range from when my brothers first started walking to now. I feel like these photos are metaphoric. As not only are my brothers walking down a path, these photos show them walking through life, growing and changing with each step they take. It may sound cliché but looking through those makes me so proud of my brothers. How far they have come, how much they have grown. I feel that all my photos symbolize something important in my life, if you look deep enough. I feel that the best way to make connections with our world through photography is to combine images of many important times. For example, If I wanted to spread a message about gender inequality, my first thought would be to create collaborative photos of Alice Paul and other Feminist protest events. Alice Paul was a suffragist who advocated for women’s rights. She was arrested after holding a protest to campaign so women would receive the right to vote. In jail, she was treated terribly and force fed after going on a hunger strike. She is a true inspiration and because of the work her and others did, we have the right to vote. So If I wanted to spread a message about equality, I would make a collage of photos of her. She stood up against a norm in her society and brought change even though she struggled because of it. Paul is proof that If you want something you have to fight for it and even though you may struggle, you may just start a revolution. To me, this is what photos should do. They should tell a story that allows people to connect/relate to the photo. Everyone can relate to having something or someone in their life who helps them through hard events, and everyone can relate to watching someone they love grow up or breaking the status quo. </p>
